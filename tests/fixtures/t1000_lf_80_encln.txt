One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself trans
formed in his bed into a horrible vermin.\nHe lay on his armour-like back, and i
f he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and d
ivided by arches into stiff sections.\nThe bedding was hardly able to cover it a
nd seemed ready to slide off any moment.\nHis many legs, pitifully thin compared
 with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's 
happened to me?\n" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room 
although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.\nA 
collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelli
ng salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of 
an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.\nIt showed a lady fi
tted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff th
at covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.\nGregor then turned to
 look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting t
he pane, which made him feel quite sad.\n"How about if I sleep a little bit long
er and forget all this nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unab
le to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state 
couldn't get into that position.\nHowever hard he threw himself onto his right, 
he always rolled back to where he was.\nHe must have tried it a hundred times, s
hut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only 
stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt bef
ore.\n"Oh, God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've chosen! Tr
avelling day in and day out.\nDoing business like this takes much more effort th
an doing your own business at home, and on top of that there's the curse of trav
elling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact 
with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or b
ecome friendly with them.\nIt can all go to Hell!\n" He felt a slight itch up on
 his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that h
e could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was cove
red with lots of little white spots which he didn't know what to make of; and wh
en he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back becau
se as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder.\nHe slid back int
o his former position. "Getting up early all the time", he thought, "it makes yo
u stupid.\nYou've got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life
 of luxury.\nFor instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morn
ing to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eat
ing their breakfasts.\nI ought to just try that with my boss; I'd get kicked out
 on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me.\nIf I di
dn't have my parents to think about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago,
 I'd have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everythin
g I would, let him know just what I feel.\nHe'd fall right off his desk!\nAnd it
's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at
 your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close 
because the boss is hard of hearing.\nWell, there's still some hope; once I've g
ot the money together to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five or six y
ears I suppose - that's definitely what I'll do.\nThat's when I'll make the big 
change. First of all though, I've got to get up, my train leaves at five.\n" And
 he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. "God in Hea
ven! " he thought.\nIt was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwa
rds, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven.\nHad the alar
m clock not rung?\nHe could see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clo
ck as it should have been; it certainly must have rung.\nYes, but was it possibl
e to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise?\nTrue, he had not slep
t peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he d
o now?\nThe next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to 
rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not
 at all feel particularly fresh and lively.\nAnd even if he did catch the train 
he would not avoid his boss's anger as the office assistant would have been ther
e to see the five o'clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor
's not being there a long time ago.\nThe office assistant was the boss's man, sp
ineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported sick?\nBut that wo
uld be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service Gregor h
ad never once yet been ill.\nHis boss would certainly come round with the doctor
 from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, an
d accept the doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believe
d that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy.\nAnd what's more, would h
e have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor\n
